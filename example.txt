Server pre-processing information and handing it back through Jinja
1. Person(client) <- waiter(HTTP request)  <- cook(server)


Versus:

Client making a request to the server 
and then the server processing that information 
and then giving back what the client wants
1. Person (client) -> waiter (HTTP request) -> cook(server)
2. Person(client) <- waiter(HTTP request)  <- cook(server)
